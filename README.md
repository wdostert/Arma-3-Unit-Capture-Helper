# Arma-3-Unit-Capture-Helper
A small python script to remove some of the tedium of creating all the files for unit capture

Support for unit_CaptureFiring will be added soon

Usage:

1. Record your unit data with the BIS_fnc_unitCapture function (Example: rec = [unitname,180] spawn BIS_fnc_unitCapture;)
2. Place the unitCaptureHelper.py script in your mission folder
3. Run the script and follow the instructions
4. Put the created script to play the path in your mission

It is recommended to delete the script when you are finished making your mission.
